Assignment: Total 100 points, 17.5% of the overall class grade

Please get started early as this assignment will take you longer than you think.

Requirements:

For this assignment use your Cloud9 environment, to create a Python based interactive menu-driven application. The following components or functionality must be present in your application:

<ol>

 <li>Uses at least one DynamoDB table</li>

 <li>Uses at least one S3 bucket</li>

 <li>Includes a Menu driven interface with at least 6 menu items.</li>

 <li>Provides a user guide showing how to use the application, explains how the concept for your application was developed, and provides detailed testing for all components and functions used in your application Other requirements:</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Your menu should check for user entry errors and be prompted for input again if needed</li>

 <li>Code must be written in Python</li>

 <li>Code must be written in the Cloud9 AWS environment provided</li>

 <li>Use boto3 as the main library using the AWS service</li>

 <li>Include code comments and document with who did what</li>

 <li>Test to make sure all functions, branches and functionality works Some possible application thoughts include but are not limited to:</li>

 <li>Game application (Q&amp;A quiz, cards, rock-paper-scissors …) with a leader board saved in DynamoDB</li>

 <li>Stock market buy/sell tool</li>

 <li>Weather app providing 10-day forecasts for user selected regions</li>
